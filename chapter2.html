        <p class="dropcap">"Curiouser and curiouser!" cried Alice. She forgot how to speak good English in that moment. "Now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet! Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?"</p>

        <p>Just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall; she was now more than nine feet high. She took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.</p>

        <p>She lay down and looked through the door into the garden with one eye; but she still couldn’t get through. She sat down and cried, until a large pool of tears formed around her, stretching halfway down the hall.</p>

        <p>Soon, she heard little footsteps approaching. It was the White Rabbit again, now splendidly dressed with gloves and a fan. "Oh! the Duchess! She’ll be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!" he muttered.</p>

        <p>Alice timidly tried to speak, but the Rabbit was startled, dropped everything, and ran off. Alice picked up the fan and gloves, and as she talked to herself, noticed she was shrinking again. She dropped the fan just in time to stop shrinking altogether.</p>

        <p>Back at the little door, she found it still shut and the key still unreachable. As she stepped backward, she slipped—splash!—right into the pool of tears she had made earlier when she was nine feet tall.</p>

        <p>In the pool she saw another creature swimming. It was a Mouse. "Would it be of any use to speak to it?" she wondered. So she tried. "O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool?"</p>

        <p>When the Mouse said nothing, Alice thought maybe it was French and said, "Où est ma chatte?" The Mouse jumped in fear. Alice apologized and explained about her cat Dinah.</p>

        <p>The Mouse, quite offended, exclaimed, "Not like cats! Would you like cats, if you were me?"</p>

        <p>Trying to make peace, Alice mentioned a nice dog she knew—but the Mouse was just as horrified. It swam away quickly, and Alice gently called after it, asking it to return and promising not to talk about cats or dogs.</p>

        <p>At last, the Mouse agreed. "Let us get to the shore and then I’ll tell you my history," it said. By then the pool was full of creatures—Ducks, Dodos, Lories, Eaglets, and more—and they all swam together toward land.</p>
