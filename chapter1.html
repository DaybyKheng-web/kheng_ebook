        <p class="dropcap">Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice, "without pictures or conversations?"</p>

        <p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>

        <p>There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!" But when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet...</p>

        <p>...and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. In another moment, down went Alice after it!</p>

        <p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well.</p>

        <p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time to look about her. She looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar labeled "ORANGE MARMALADE"—but to her disappointment, it was empty.</p>

        <p>Down, down, down! Would the fall never come to an end? There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking to herself. "Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!" (Dinah was the cat.) "I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!"</p>

        <p>Alice felt that she was dozing off, when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p>

        <p>She found herself in a long, low hall, lit by lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all around, but they were locked. After trying every door sadly, she came upon a little table made of solid glass with a tiny golden key on it...</p>

        <p>...which, after a few tries, fit a small door behind a curtain. She opened it and found a passage leading to a beautiful garden, but she was too big to fit through.</p>

        <p>Back at the table she found a small bottle labeled "DRINK ME". She checked to make sure it wasn’t marked poison, tasted it, and finding it delicious, drank the whole thing. "What a curious feeling! I must be shutting up like a telescope!"</p>

        <p>Sure enough, she shrank down to ten inches high and was delighted—until she realized she had forgotten the key on the table and couldn’t reach it again.</p>

        <p>She discovered a small cake labeled "EAT ME" and decided, either way, it would help her get into the garden. She ate it and waited to see which way she would grow...</p>
