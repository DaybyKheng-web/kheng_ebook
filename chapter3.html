        <p class="dropcap">They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with wet feathers, the animals with damp fur, and all of them dripping, uncomfortable, and cross.</p>

        <p>The first concern was how to get dry again. After a short discussion, the Mouse, who seemed like a leader, called out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I’ll soon make you dry enough!”</p>

        <p>They sat in a ring as the Mouse began a dull history lecture about William the Conqueror. It didn’t help. Alice remained soaking wet.</p>

        <p>The Dodo then proposed something different. “A Caucus-race!” it said. Without explanation, the race began, and everyone ran whenever they liked, stopping when they chose. After a while, the Dodo declared, “Everybody has won, and all must have prizes.”</p>

        <p>But Alice wasn’t paying attention, and the Mouse noticed. It was insulted and stormed off. Alice and the others called after it, but it didn’t return.</p>

        <p>Trying to lighten the mood, Alice mentioned her cat Dinah again. The reaction was instant—birds flew away, animals scattered, and she was left alone once more, feeling very sad and missing home.</p>
